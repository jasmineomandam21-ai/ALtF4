February Goal: Build a Strong Foundation in Binary Exploitation (Pwn)

WEEK 1 — Binary Exploitation Fundamentals
Main Topic: Understanding how binaries execute 

Checklist
☐ Understand basic binary structure and execution flow
☐ Identify where and how user input is processed
☐ Understand stack layout and function call behavior
☐ Recognize unsafe memory operations
☐ Trigger and analyze controlled crashes
☐ Use debugging to observe register and memory changes
☐ Develop intuition for why programs crash

Goal1: Cause a controlled crash in a binary and clearly explain what memory corruption occurred and why
Goal2: Build a repeatable analysis workflow for inspecting and debugging unfamiliar binaries


WEEK 2 — Stack-Based Binary Exploitation
Main Topic: Exploiting stack memory corruption to control program execution

Checklist
☐ Identify stack-based buffers and vulnerable input points
☐ Understand how return addresses are stored and used
☐ Determine precise overwrite offsets
☐ Redirect execution flow intentionally
☐ Invoke unintended program behavior through memory corruption
☐ Distinguish between crashes and controlled execution


 Goal: Hijack program execution flow by overwriting stack control data
 Goal 2: Build a repeatable analysis workflow for inspecting and debugging unfamiliar binaries

 WEEK 3 — Exploitation With Basic Protections
 Main Topic: Adapting exploitation techniques to protected binaries
