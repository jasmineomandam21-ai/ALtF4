My Cybersecurity Monthly Roadmap
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
February – Binary Exploitation & Reverse Engineering
Goal: Understand low‑level program behavior and exploit binaries.

    Focus Areas:

    Finish OverTheWire Bandit to sharpen Linux basics.

    Learn GDB debugging and buffer overflow fundamentals.

    Solve beginner pwn challenges.

    Join a CTF focusing on binary exploitation/reversing.

Outcome: Ability to analyze and exploit simple binaries, familiarity with assembly and debugging.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

March – Web Exploitation & Reconnaissance

Goal: Build strong foundations in web vulnerabilities and reconnaissance techniques.

    Focus Areas:

    Complete beginner web exploitation challenges (picoCTF, TryHackMe).

    Practice solving easy web CTF problems (HackTheBox, Root‑Me).

    Participate in a live CTF focusing only on web challenges.

Outcome: Comfort with common web flaws (SQLi, XSS, directory traversal, etc.).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

April – Cryptography & Forensics

    Goal: Gain skills in breaking weak crypto and analyzing digital evidence.

    Focus Areas:

    Complete CryptoPals Set 1 challenges.

    Practice picoCTF forensics problems.

    Solve mixed crypto/forensics challenges.

    Join a CTF focusing on crypto/forensics.

Outcome: Comfort with classical ciphers, hashing, encoding, and forensic analysis (logs, memory dumps, file carving).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

May – OSINT & Specialization

    Goal: Explore OSINT and decide my specialties.

    Focus Areas:

    Practice OSINT with TraceLabs or similar platforms.

    Review all categories and reflect on which felt most natural.

    Choose 2 specialties + 1 secondary to focus on long‑term.

    Deep dive into chosen specialties during CTFs.

Outcome: Clear direction for my cybersecurity journey, with defined specialties.
