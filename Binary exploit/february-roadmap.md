February Goal: Build a Strong Foundation in Binary Exploitation (Pwn)

WEEK 1 — Binary Exploitation Fundamentals
Main Topic: Understanding how binaries execute and how memory corruption begins

Checklist
☐ Understand basic binary structure and execution flow
☐ Identify where and how user input is processed
☐ Understand stack layout and function call behavior
☐ Recognize unsafe memory operations
☐ Trigger and analyze controlled crashes
☐ Use debugging to observe register and memory changes
☐ Develop intuition for why programs crash

Goal1: Cause a controlled crash in a binary and clearly explain what memory corruption occurred and why
Goal2: Build a repeatable analysis workflow for inspecting and debugging unfamiliar binaries
