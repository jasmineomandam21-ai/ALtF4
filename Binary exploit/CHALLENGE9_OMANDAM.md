# **Write-Up: Format String 0**

When I first connected to the server using nc mimas.picoctf.net 58467, I honestly thought it would just be a simple input challenge. The burger shop theme looked playful, but I quickly realized something unusual was happening with the inputs.

For the first customer, Patrick, I selected **Gr%114d\_Cheese** exactly as written. Instead of printing the burger name normally, the output became distorted:

Gr 4202954\_Cheese

That was my first clue. The %114d was clearly being interpreted as a **format specifier**, not plain text. It was behaving like a printf vulnerability. That’s when I understood this was a **format string exploitation challenge**.

The second customer’s hint said SpongeBob wanted something outrageous that would “break the shop.” That phrase immediately made me think of causing a crash — specifically a **segmentation fault**. I initially tried manipulating inputs like Pe%to\_Portobello%s, but the program rejected them as invalid burgers.

Then I looked more carefully at the provided options. One of them was:

Cla%sic\_Che%s%steak

This burger name itself contained multiple %s format specifiers. That was suspicious. Instead of modifying it, I entered it exactly as written.

The output became corrupted:

ClaCla%sic\_Che%s%steakic\_Che(null)

And then suddenly   the flag appeared:

**picoCTF{7h3\_cu570m3r\_15\_n3v3r\_SEGFAULT\_ef312157}**

At that moment, I understood the vulnerability clearly. The program was likely using something like:

*printf(user\_input);*

instead of:

*printf("%s", user\_input);*

Because of that, the %s specifiers inside the burger name were interpreted by printf, causing it to read unintended memory addresses. This memory mismanagement triggered abnormal behavior, effectively “breaking the shop” and revealing the flag.

### **Challenges I Faced**

* At first, I didn’t immediately recognize it as a format string vulnerability.

* I tried manually injecting %s into other burger names, but the program validated inputs strictly.

* It took careful observation of the first distorted output to understand that the provided menu itself contained the exploit.
