## **Write-Up: Transformation**

When I opened the challenge, the Python code immediately stood out. It was taking two characters at a time, shifting one by 8 bits, adding them together, and turning that into a single Unicode character. That explained why the encoded output looked like a string of Chinese characters — the flag had been transformed from **8-bit ASCII** into **16-bit Unicode**.

Instead of writing a decoder myself, I turned to **CyberChef**, a tool I often use for quick transformations. I pasted the encoded text into CyberChef and ran the **Magic** operation with deeper analysis enabled. Within seconds, the tool recognized the transformation and produced the decoded flag:

**picoCTF{16\_bits\_inst34d\_of\_8\_b7f62ca5}**

### **Reflection**

This challenge reminded me that even simple bitwise operations can make text look completely foreign. At first, the Chinese characters seemed confusing, but once I understood the encoding logic, the solution became clear. Using CyberChef saved time and showed the value of knowing when to rely on tools versus coding from scratch. It reinforced the idea that problem-solving in CTFs is often about combining understanding with resourcefulness.
