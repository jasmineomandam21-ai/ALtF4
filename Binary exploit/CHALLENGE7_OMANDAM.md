## **Write-Up: VaultDoorTraining**

When I opened the challenge file **VaultDoorTraining.java**, I immediately noticed that the program was asking for a vault password. Reading through the code, I saw how it handled user input:

String input \= userInput.substring("picoCTF{".length(), userInput.length()-1);

This line revealed something important — the program expected the flag to start with **picoCTF{**, and it would strip that part off before checking the rest of the password. That meant the actual secret was hidden further down in the code.

Scrolling a bit, I found the `checkPassword` function:

return password.equal**s("w4rm1ng\_Up\_w1tH\_jAv4\_000WWjzOMm7");**

There it was  the full password hardcoded inside the source. To reconstruct the flag, I simply added the prefix and suffix back:

**picoCTF{w4rm1ng\_Up\_w1tH\_jAv4\_000WWjzOMm7}**

### **Reflection**

This was honestly the easiest challenge I’ve solved. The password was sitting right there in the source code, and all I had to do was piece it together with the proper format. It reminded me that sometimes in CTFs, the solution isn’t about complex reversing or heavy tools — it’s about carefully reading what’s in front of you. It reinforced the idea that paying attention to details can be just as powerful as technical skill.
