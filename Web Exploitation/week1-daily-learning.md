Week 1 – Daily Learning Log (Web Exploitation)
Day 1 – Introduction to Web Exploitation

Today, I learned what web exploitation is and why it is important in cybersecurity. I understood that web exploitation focuses on finding and abusing weaknesses in web applications. I was introduced to the attacker vs defender mindset, where attackers look for vulnerabilities while defenders focus on securing systems. This helped me understand why developers must think like attackers to improve security.

Day 2 – How the Web Works (HTTP/HTTPS)

On this day, I studied how web applications communicate using HTTP and HTTPS. I learned what requests and responses are and how a browser talks to a server. I also learned the difference between HTTP and HTTPS, and why HTTPS is more secure because it encrypts data. This lesson helped me understand how data travels on the web.

Day 3 – GET vs POST Requests

Today, I focused on GET and POST requests. I learned that GET is usually used to retrieve data and can be seen in the URL, while POST is used to send data securely. I practiced identifying GET and POST requests using simple examples. This made me realize how attackers can take advantage of poorly handled requests.

Day 4 – Cookies and Sessions

I learned about cookies and sessions and how websites remember users. Cookies store small pieces of data on the browser, while sessions are handled on the server side. I understood how login systems depend on sessions and why poor session handling can lead to security issues like session hijacking.

Day 5 – Browser Developer Tools

For the last day of Week 1, I explored browser Developer Tools, especially the Network tab. I practiced inspecting requests, responses, headers, and cookies. This helped me see real data being sent between the browser and server. I realized that DevTools is a very important tool for both developers and attackers.

Week 1 Reflection

Overall, Week 1 helped me understand the basic foundation of how web applications work. I learned that before exploiting vulnerabilities, it is important to understand how the web functions normally. This week gave me a clearer idea of what web exploitation is and prepared me for learning about actual vulnerabilities in the next weeks.
